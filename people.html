			<p> John Warnock had left Xerox to found Adobe Systems in order to commercialize PostScript in a laser printer they intended to market. Jobs was aware of Warnock's
			efforts, and on his return to California he started working on convincing Warnock to allow Apple to license PostScript for a new printer that Apple would sell. 
			Negotiations between Apple and Adobe over the use of Postscript began in 1983 and an agreement was reached in December 1983, one month before Macintosh was announced. 
			Jobs eventually arranged for Apple to buy $2.5 million in Adobe stock. He is also the father of Seybold. </p>

			<p>The US company Aldus Corporation was founded in February 1984 in Seattle, Washington, by Paul Brainerd. 
			The flagship program of Aldus Coâ€”PageMaker was released in July 1985. This groundbreaking program was the first ever desktop publishing 
			application and revolutionized the use of personal computers, virtually creating the desktop publishing industry. The term desktop publishing was itself coined by Brainerd..</p>
