		<p>The history of personal desktop publishing has many bright minds in technology 
		companies that were startups at that time. It all started with John Warnock, who left Xerox to be a founder of Adobe Systems to commercialize PostScript
		with laser printers. Apple Computers and Steve Jobs were in a heated competition with IBM to sell the better personal computer. In 1984, Apple was only second to IBM's
		computer due to lack of features such as working with spreadsheets and working with complex calculations. In addition, Apple charged double the price than IBM. Jobs
		saw this and knew he had to do something different to take over the competition.He met with Warnock and agreed to sign an exclusive deal between Adobe and Macintosh. 
		This would allow postscript to be used with Macintosh computers. Jobs eventually arranged for Apple to buy $2.5 million in Adobe stock.	
		At about the same time, Jonathan Seybold (John W's son) introduced Paul Brainerd to Apple, where he learned of Apple's laser printer efforts and saw the potential for a 
		new program using the Mac's GUI to produce PostScript output for the new printer. Arranging his own funding through a venture capital firm, Brainerd formed Aldus and began 
		development of what would become PageMaker. Adobe took over Aldus and continued to name the projects after them. <!--This excerpt has been taken from: David Wilma, "Brainerd, Paul (b. 1947)", HistoryLink, February 22, 2006-->
